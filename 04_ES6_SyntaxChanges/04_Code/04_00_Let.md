# ES6 Syntax Changes

## Let keyword

Prior to ES6 the only way to declare a variable in javascript was using
`var` keyword.Let us discuss common two problems faced by `var` in javascript.

### Problem 1 - var and type safety

In the below example we first declare a variable `balance` of number type and later it is replaced with object type .So variables declared with `var` has dynamic typing , we can swap types. This may lead to type safety issues.

```html
<script>
var balance = 5000
console.log(typeof balance)
//dynamically types can be changed
balance = {message:"hello"}
console.log(typeof balance)

</script>
```

output is :

```javascript
number
object
```

### Problem 2 - var and block scope

let us take another example where displaying iteration value using `var` keyword. In the given example the variable `i` is declared inside for loop , so we expect it to be accessed only with in the loop. But the scope of `var` is outside for loop in the given case.

<!-- example2.html -->
```html
<script>
for (var i=1;i<=5;i++){
    console.log(i);
}
console.log("after the loop i value is "+i);

</script>
```

output of the above will be

```javascript
1
2
3
4
5
after the loop i value is 6
```

Even though we have declared `var i` inside the for loop the value of i can be accessed outside the loop and within the `script` block.The problem is that since we will be writing many lines of code during software development possibility of block level scope is needed.We can not trust `var` keyword in that case.

### Solution 1 - let and type safety

 ES6 introduces `let` keyword which is the replacement of `var`.
The following example shows the type safety of variables declared with `let` . Once we initialize balance to `number` type we cannot change it to `object` type.

<!-- example3.html -->
```html
<script>
let balance = 5000 // number type
console.log(typeof balance)

//dynamically types cannot be changed
balance = {message:"hello"} // changing number to object type
console.log(typeof balance)

</script>
```

```js
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'balance' has already been declared
```

Let us take the second example discussed before using let keyword

### Solution 2 - let and block scope

<!-- example4.html -->
```html
<script>
for (let i=1;i<=5;i++){
    console.log(i);
}
console.log("after the loop i value is "+i);

</script>
```

output will be as shown.

```javascript
1
2
3
4
5
Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined
```

## Example  - hoisting

Hoisting feature in javascript allows a variable to be used before it is actually declared. So programmer can delay the declaration of variable .Javascript runtime will scan for variable declarations and put them to top of the block scope .The variables declared with `var` get hoisted to the top of block.

```html
<script>
// variable company is hoisted to top , var company = undefined
console.log(company); // using variable before declaring
var company = "TutorialsPoint"; // declare and initialized here


</script>

```

output will be

```js
undefined
```

The same example if we try with `let` keyword , we get error.

```html
<script>

console.log(company)
let company= "TutorialsPoint"

</script>

```

output is shown below

```js
 Uncaught ReferenceError: company is not defined
```

### Example  - let and multiple block scope

Any time you use let it will last as long as the brackets lasts.Let us understand with below example.

The variable `count` is declared at script level and value is 100.When program executes the loop a block scope is created and variable `count` of value 1 is created.Similarly when if condition is executed ,a new block scope is created and `count` variable of 50 is created.

```html
<script>
let count=100
for (let count =1;count<=10;count++){
    //inside for loop brackets ,count value starts from 1
console.log("count value inside loop is ",count);
}
//outside for loop brackets ,count value is 100
console.log("count value after loop is",count);

if(count==100){
    //inside  if brackets ,count value is 50
  let count=50;
  console.log("count inside if block",count);
}

console.log(count);
</script>
```

output is as shown

```html
 count value inside loop is  1
 count value inside loop is  2
 count value inside loop is  3
 count value inside loop is  4
 count value inside loop is  5
 count value inside loop is  6
 count value inside loop is  7
 count value inside loop is  8
 count value inside loop is  9
 count value inside loop is  10
 count value after loop is 100
 count inside if block 50
 100

```
