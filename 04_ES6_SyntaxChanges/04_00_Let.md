# ES6 Syntax Changes

The following chapter discusses changes to  JavaScript syntax introduced in ES6.

## Let keyword

Prior to ES6, the `var` keyword was used to declare a variable in JavaScript . Variables declared using `var` do not support block level scope, that means if a variable is declared in `loop` or `if` block it can be accessed outside the loop or if block.This is because `var` variables support hoisting.

## var and hoisting

Variable hoisting allows the use of a variable in a JavaScript program, even before it is declared.Such variables will be initialized to `undefined` by default .Javascript runtime will scan for variable declarations and put them to top of the function or script .Variables declared with `var` keyword get hoisted to the top . Consider the following example

```html
<script>
// variable company is hoisted to top , var company = undefined
console.log(company); // using variable before declaring
var company = "TutorialsPoint"; // declare and initialized here
console.log(company);

</script>

```

Output will be

```js
undefined
TutorialsPoint
```

## let and hoisting

However, variables declared using the `let` cannot be accessed before declaring. In other words, the `let` keyword does not support variable hoisting.This is shown in the example below-

```html
<script>

console.log(company)
let company= "TutorialsPoint"
console.log(company)

</script>

```

Output is shown below

```js
 Uncaught ReferenceError: company is not defined
```

### var and block scope

The block scope restricts a variableâ€™s access to the block in which it is declared. The `var` keyword assigns a function scope to the variable.
Variables declared using the `var` keyword does not have a block scope.  Consider the following example -

<!-- example2.html -->
```html
<script>
  //hoisted to top ; var i = undefined
for (var i=1;i<=5;i++){
    console.log(i);
}
console.log("after the loop i value is "+i);

</script>
```

Output of the above code will be

```javascript
1
2
3
4
5
after the loop i value is 6
```
The variable `i` is declared inside the for loop using the `var` keyword.The variable `i`  is accessible outside the loop. However at times,there might be a need to restrict a variable's access within a block.We can not use the `var` keyword in such a case.

ES6 introduces the `let` keyword to overcome the above this limitations.


### let and block scope

<!-- example4.html -->
```html
<script>
for (let i=1;i<=5;i++){ //block scope
    console.log(i);
}
//i is not available outside
console.log("after the loop i value is "+i);

</script>
```
The above example declares a variable `i` within the for loop. The compiler throws an error if we try to access the variable outside the for loop.

The output of the  code is shown below- 

```javascript
1
2
3
4
5
Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined
```

### var and block level safety

With in a given block if we declare the same variable twice using `var` keyword it will not give an error. This may lead to unexpected logical errors at runtime.

```html
      <script>
                
                var balance = 5000
                console.log(typeof balance)
                var balance = {message:"hello"}
                console.log(typeof balance)
                
        </script>

```

Output is :

```js
number
object
```

### let and block level safety

If we try to declare a `let` variable twice within the same block  it will throw an error. Consider the following example: 

<!-- example3.html -->
```html
<script>
let balance = 5000 // number type
console.log(typeof balance)

let balance = {message:"hello"} // changing number to object type
console.log(typeof balance)

</script>
```
The above code will result in the following error : 

```js
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'balance' has already been declared
```

### let and multiple blocks
 
 However the same `let` variable can be used in different block level scopes as shown with out giving any syntax errors.

**Illustration**

```html
<script>
let count=100
for (let count =1;count<=10;count++){
    //inside for loop brackets ,count value starts from 1
console.log("count value inside loop is ",count);
}
//outside for loop brackets ,count value is 100
console.log("count value after loop is",count);

if(count==100){
    //inside  if brackets ,count value is 50
  let count=50;
  console.log("count inside if block",count);
}

console.log(count);
</script>
```
Output is as shown

```html
 count value inside loop is  1
 count value inside loop is  2
 count value inside loop is  3
 count value inside loop is  4
 count value inside loop is  5
 count value inside loop is  6
 count value inside loop is  7
 count value inside loop is  8
 count value inside loop is  9
 count value inside loop is  10
 count value after loop is 100
 count inside if block 50
 100

```
